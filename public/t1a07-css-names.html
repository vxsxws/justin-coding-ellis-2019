The Watershed mine is a large open pit mine located about 160 km northwest 
of Cairns on Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland, Australia.<br>
Watershed represents one of the largest tungsten reserves in Australia 
having estimated reserves of 15.1 million tonnes of ore grading 0.46% tungsten.<br>
The mine is owned by Vital Metals who has acquired the project in 2005.
 Watershed was Vital Metals flagship project. At time of its acquisition,<br>

with the assistance of the Japan Oil,<br>Gas and Metals National Corporation.

from the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection.
<br>Access to the mine is via a track leading off the Peninsula Developmental 
Road.<br>Or from the mine will be trucked to Brisbane and exported to Japan, the US and Korea.
